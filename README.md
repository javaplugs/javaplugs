# JNeat
Small set of Java tweaks without any dependencies

## Content

### CrossLock & AppLock
Using idea of file locking to somehow synchronize code in different JVM instances (applications)
on the same computer.

**CrossLock** allows you to use lock-like functionality between multiple JVM instances on the same computer.

**AppLock** is based on ClossLock and allows you to run only one Java application instance at time.

Just look into javadocs and tests.
